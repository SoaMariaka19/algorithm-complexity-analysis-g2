/*
 * Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:
 * - First, the string is divided into the least possible number of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters
 *   for example, "aabbbc" is divided into ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
 * - Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced with a concatenation of its length and the repeating
 *   character
 *   for example, substring "bbb" is replaced by "3b"
 * - Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the same order and a new string is returned.
